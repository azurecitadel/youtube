1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,740
In this lab you have entered

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,990
parameters in a couple of different

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:10,110
ways.  You've been prompted for the values

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:12,330
interactively if it is a required

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,610
parameter and you haven't specified at

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,490
any point. That's at submission time

7
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,070
using the CLIs. The other place

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,289
is specifying the values inline. 

9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,300
PowerShell creates those additional

10
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,310
switches on the fly based on the name of

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,320
those parameters, which is why you can't

12
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,300
have parameters in your templates for

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,410
PowerShell which conflict with any

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,120
existing names such as "name".  For the

15
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,030
CLI you've got a couple of options there

16
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,300
either specifying JSON or you can

17
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:45,510
specify name=value pairs in

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,460
a space delimited list. What we're going

19
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,110
to do now is going to create a parameter

20
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,230
file and this is very useful

21
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,690
particularly if you have multiple

22
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:56,309
customers or partners and you want to

23
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,039
specify a different parameter file for

24
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:01,829
information specific to that particular

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,960
customer. 

26
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,150
We're going to create a new file.

27
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,939


28
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,799
In our lab1 folder I'm going to create a

29
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:14,880
new file and that's going to be called

30
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,500
azuredeploy.parameters.json.  You can

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,530
call it anything you like but this is the

32
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:23,159
convention. As you can see that's

33
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:25,200
opened it at the top. Now you can use

34
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,820
CTGRL+ALT+LEFT and RIGHT to move

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,860
these around.

36
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,780
Or you can drag and drop and snap them now

37
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,579
using vscode. The files are now side by

38
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,290
side. I'm also going to do CTRL+B to

39
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:36,570
close down the sidebar and give ourselves a bit

40
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,610
of space. 

41
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,710
I can see which parameters we have there.

42
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:45,689
Now I've got focus within the parameters.json

43
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:47,369
 file and if I type "armp" then it

44
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,920
should automatically show the skeleton

45
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:52,890
for the parameters. Notice this has a

46
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,290
different schema compared to the main

47
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,790
azuredeploy.json. It's very limited in

48
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,079
what it can have. It just has a parameter

49
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,939
section as well as the schema and

50
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,619
content version. The parameter

51
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,390
section itself is also fairly limited as to

52
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:06,210
what it can have. I'm going to enter in

53
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:09,000
two parameters here. Again, type "armp",

54
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,890
but this time rather than choosing skeleton, or 

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,629
arm-parameter, which is what we used in the

56
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,140
main azuredeploy.json when we're actually

57
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:15,060
declaring our parameters,

58
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,610
we're now going to specify a parameter

59
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:21,270
value. And that parameter value

60
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:24,870
is going to be storageAccountPrefix

61
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:27,090
and I'm going to specify a value which

62
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,770
is going to be "richeneysa", just to

63
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,350
show it's different to stg, which is

64
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:34,680
the default value on the left hand side.

65
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:39,600
If I move the cursor to there and

66
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:41,210
then if I put a comma, then enter, then we

67
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,920
should be able to put in another

68
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:49,830
parameter value.  Now we're going to

69
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:51,090
go for accountType and the value you're

70
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:55,260
going to have here is going to be

71
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:56,520
"Standard_LRS" which again is the

72
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,950
default, but we're going to make it

73
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,290
explicit within this. 

74
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,450
Again there should be no problems

75
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,980
in that file. There, as you can see, we can

76
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,140
shrink up parameters and it closes

77
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,480
everything down. We can close down the

78
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,910
individual parameters within it and they

79
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,180
will be neatly aligned.  That is a good

80
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:20,820
parameter file. If we then open

81
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:22,530
up the area, go back into the lab 1 folder

82
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:25,050
so now we've got both the azuredeploy

83
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,390
and parameters file. If you want to

84
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:38,790
submit using these then you can do

85
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:40,820
"az group deployment create" and then

86
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,370
specify again the resource group

87
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:48,140
we're submitting into, which is lab1,

88
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:55,130
the template file, azuredeploy.json,

89
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:58,110
then the parameters,

90
00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:02,130
rather than having name=value

91
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:04,680
as a list, we're going to use the @

92
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:08,720
operator to signify that it's a file.

93
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:11,610
Enter "@azuredeploy.parameters.json".

94
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,880
That is the full command for the submission.

95
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:16,530
Press enter then again it will

96
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,720
validate both of those files.

97
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:21,239


98
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,620


99
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,169
If everything is good then it will submit

100
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,940
those and we should get the resulting

101
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:30,260
storage account with richeneysa

102
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,260
as the prefix instead of our default.

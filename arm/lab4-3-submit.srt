1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,830
Let's test this conditional template

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,839
by submitting it twice. Once

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,809
creating a virtual machine which has a

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,059
public IP,  and once again where we do not

5
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:13,980
specify the dnsLabelPrefix so that it

6
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:16,109
shouldn't create the pip, and will define

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,630
the NIC differently as a result. You'll

8
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,850
notice that in the output section I have

9
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:24,210
removed all of the properties within

10
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,849
that object. That's because we have the

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,920
public IP address as one of those

12
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:31,260
outputs so just to make life simple I've

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:35,130
removed that for the moment. 

14
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:37,590
Let's open up the integrated terminal.

15
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:41,510
I'm going to go into the lab4 folder

16
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:49,079
where our files are sitting and I'm going to

17
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:54,079
create a lab4 resource group and

18
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,079
put into West Europe as per normal.

19
00:00:54,379 --> 00:01:01,199


20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,760
As I'm deploying a couple I'm going to

21
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,439
create myself an alias. This is one thing

22
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,170
you can do in Bash. So I'm going to do an

23
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,770
alias and I'm going to call my alias 

24
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:15,299
'deploy' and that is going to be set to 

25
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:16,799
'az group deployments create'. I'm not

26
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,840
going to specify name or parameters as I want to

27
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,939
be able to control those but in terms of

28
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,680
the resource group I'm going to default

29
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,170
that to be whatever folder I'm in at the

30
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,920
moment so I'll make that the basename

31
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,270
of whatever we print for the working

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,900
directory where we are the moment. That

33
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:38,400
should return lab4. Then I'm going

34
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:41,369
to specify my template file as

35
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,610
azuredeploy.json.

36
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:45,990
That will save me a little bit typing in a second.

37
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,280
If I do "alias deploy",

38
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,829
you can see that's been set

39
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,600
successfully.  So let's then then deploy

40
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:52,500
using that command. Imagine

41
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,240
that's been replaced by that whole

42
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,250
command, and then I'm going to set the

43
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,850
name for first deployment job as public

44
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:04,140
and for that we're going to specify our

45
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:10,129
parameters file so that will be 

46
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:12,060
"@azuredeploy.parameters.json"

47
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:15,720
and I'm also going to have a couple

48
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:22,190
of inline overrides specifying 

49
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:29,370
vmName=public and 

50
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:31,410
dnsLabelPrefix=richeneypublicvm.

51
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:34,050
So let's submit that. I'm also going

52
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:36,590
to put in a --no-wait so I'm just going to

53
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:39,900
have that deploying in the background. That

54
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:42,300
should submit the job with those two

55
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:49,680
within it. I'm then going to do exactly

56
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:52,380
the same again, but I'm going to change

57
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,560
some of these. I will get rid of

58
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:59,790
the dnsLabelPrefix, I'm going to change

59
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:05,790
that to private and I'll change that one

60
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:07,049
to private. Not a great naming convention

61
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:15,450
for you virtual machines but it should

62
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:20,120
show what we've got. And if we do a

63
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:23,400
deployment list for our resource group

64
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:26,040
lab4 then you should see the two

65
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,970
jobs are sitting within there. I'll do

66
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:36,209
that as a table so it's a bit more

67
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:37,859
readable and there's our two running

68
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:40,650
jobs. So I'll have a look at those in a minute

69
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:42,900
once it's created but in the meantime we

70
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:46,440
should be able to have a look at the

71
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:49,440
resources and list those out for our

72
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,609
resource group. By the way you can see

73
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,690
I'm using the --resource-groups switch a lot

74
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:53,400
of times. I probably want to use

75
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,870
"as configure --defaults" if

76
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,510
you're doing a lot of commands in a

77
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:01,019
resource group and specify "group=lab4".

78
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:02,700
Hopefully it has

79
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:04,400
started creating some of the resources. 

80
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,900
If you remember the public IP addresses

81
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,250
are not contingent on anything else,

82
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,329
they've got no dependency so they should

83
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,670
be created straight away so you can see

84
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:14,130
the public NIC and the public PIP is

85
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,739
being created but we only have a private

86
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,329
NIC so that's already looking quite

87
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:23,280
good. I'll pipe those to sort so they're in a

88
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:25,110
slightly better order. OK, so there you

89
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,740
can see that for the private one we've

90
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,910
got just a NIC,

91
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,590
for the public one we've got both 

92
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,819
a NIC and a PIP.

93
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,819
That's coming through quite neatly. Good.

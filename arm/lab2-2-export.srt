1
00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:06,660
We're now going to create a template

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:09,090
by exporting something out of the Azure

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,349
portal. This is a very common thing to do

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,090
if you're dealing with new resources,

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,230
and they show up in the portal

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,250
and you then want to be able to do

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,960
those programmatically.

8
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,699
We're going to do that by clicking on

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,439
create resource and we're going to do a

10
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:26,220
Web App here and so I select the Web App

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:27,689
and then once the details come up then

12
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,859
we will start going through. We're not

13
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:29,789
going to click on this blue Create

14
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,859
button, we're going to look at the

15
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:34,320
automation options down here. Let's just

16
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:37,440
put these details in. I'm going to put

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,680
a name for my web apps, "richeneyarm".

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,200
I'm also going to put it into a

19
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,360
new resource group called lab2.

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,489


21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,140
I'm going to choose my App Service Plan,

22
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:50,879
I want to put this on the Free tier,

23
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,820
and hard-code this to that Free tier.

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,850
I'm going to create new and then

25
00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:01,370
within that I can specify the location

26
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,370
which I'm going to put into West Europe.

27
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:07,920
Service plan I'll name "richeneyarm-plan".

28
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:11,490
We're going to change the tier.

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,750
There's the new dialog box for this.

30
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,960
We're going to change that

31
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:20,280
to dev / test and then choose

32
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,990
the free tier and apply OK.

33
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,930
We're now on the Free tier with the F1 size. 

34
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:27,030
Click OK that should then take that

35
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,130
through. 

36
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,890
Rather than click Create,

37
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:35,340
go into automation options.

38
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:37,259
This automatically generates JSON files

39
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,630
for both the parameter file and

40
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,280
template file which gives us a useful

41
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,869
starting point for taking these and then

42
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,939
customizing. That's what we want to do so

43
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,909
if I click into the area for the main

44
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:50,640
pane and do CTRL-A and CTRL-C to copy

45
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:54,090
the contents of that, I can then click

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,390
back over to our Visual Studio Code area.

47
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:01,189
Then if I create a new file,

48
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:05,850
called "lab2/azuredeploy.json",

49
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:08,910
then I can paste the contents into

50
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:11,160
there.  And save the file.

51
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,700
Create a new file 

52
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,410
that is called

53
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:18,060
azuredeploy.parameters.json.

54
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:21,230


55
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:25,500
And then when we go back we can select

56
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:28,020
parameters file, take the contents of that

57
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,280
and paste that in, and that gives us the

58
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,700
two files ready for us to start

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,700
customizing.

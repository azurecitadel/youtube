1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:05,549
OK, so we're going to create a resource

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,680
group on the command line and then

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:09,630
deploy our small template into that

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,650
resource group. Some of the commands can

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,549
get quite long so I'm going to use

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,870
CTRL+B to toggle the sidebar and then

7
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:17,970
you can see we're in the arm-workshop

8
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,939
directory. I'm going to move down into

9
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,710
the lab1 folder which is where the

10
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,920
azuredeploy.json file actually

11
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,029
sits. Just 'clear' that to tidy that up. I'm

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,109
now going to create the resource

13
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:32,579
group so 'az group create' then the name

14
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,850
of our resource group which will be

15
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:38,780
lab1 and then location-wise put that into West

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,100
Europe as we will do all the resources.

17
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,800
That'll take a second or two to go

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,969
through. If you find yourself

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,860
persistently deploying into the same

20
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:48,539
location and you want to shorten some of

21
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,680
the command line arguments you're using

22
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,960
personally (rather than something

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,070
scripted) then have a look at `'az configure'

24
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,649
because then you can set that as a

25
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,140
default within that. OK, so now we've got

26
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:02,309
our resource group I'm going to do an

27
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:05,100
'az group deployment create' and then I'm going

28
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:06,600
to give this a name of job one. This is the

29
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,860
name of the deployment job you'll see in

30
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,500
the resource group when we have a look

31
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:13,770
in the portal later on.  If you don't

32
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,530
specify a name for the job it will just

33
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,630
take it from the basename of the file that we're

34
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,860
using. So ours is called azuredeploy.json,

35
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,780
it'll be called azuredeploy,

36
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,990
deployed but we're going to specify our

37
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,900
jobname here. I'm going to select

38
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,729
the azuredeploy.json file that we have

39
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,850
in this folder. I'm just using the

40
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:35,130
autocomplete for that, and then the

41
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:39,750
resource group are going to submit into

42
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:42,960
which is lab1. I hit enter there then

43
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:45,600
it should take a look at that file,

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,520
validate it and then submit it through

45
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,590
the ARM layer and show that it's running

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,439
at this point. If we then give that

47
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,430
about 30 seconds then it will come up

48
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,430
with something that's completed.

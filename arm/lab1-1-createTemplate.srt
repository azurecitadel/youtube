1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:05,069
OK, so if you've got everything set up

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,770
then this should be how your screen

3
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:09,750
currently looks. If you hover over the

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,700
ARM-WORKSHOP bar and click on the new

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,920
file icon - you can do CTRL+N as well if

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:18,690
you prefer - and then type in 

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,130
"lab1/azuredeploy.json".  It will

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,140
create the file and the folder at the

9
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,460
same time and you can see it's focused

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,279
automatically on the pane on the right

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,289
hand side. If you type "arm!"

12
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:30,750
at that point then it will

13
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,009
select the skeleton template from the ARM

14
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,200
snippets. If you don't see the ARM

15
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,790
snippets then double check everything you've done

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,410
for the set up. You should have a

17
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,610
snippets file which you imported at some

18
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:43,950
point which you'll find down here within

19
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:45,960
Settings and User Snippets.  If it

20
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,210
does work then when you hit enter you should

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,530
see the default template come in. You'll

22
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,899
notice there's a round dot which

23
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,570
shows there's unsaved changes, up on the

24
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:59,690
tab.  If I do CTRL+S that will then save it,

25
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,690
now we have saved the changes.  Ready to go.

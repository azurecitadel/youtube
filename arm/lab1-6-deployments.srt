1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,580
I've opened up the portal and

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,750
navigated into the lab1 resource group.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,179
As you can see we've got our

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,280
storage account.

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,049
Click on deployments in the blade

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,240
on the left hand side to show the

7
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:16,800
deployment jobs and you'll see job1

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,410
has been listed there. Click on

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,850
job1 then it will open up and you can

10
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,230
see the overview listing the

11
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,640
various resources it's deployed.

12
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,070
Just the simple storage account for us.

13
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,300


14
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,560
You can look at what that template

15
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,019
looked like at that submission point in

16
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,210
time. If you are structured in your

17
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:34,980
naming conventions for your

18
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,989
deployment jobs then you can always go

19
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,700
back and see what's that looked like.

20
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:40,710
It automatically creates a parameters

21
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,750
file at the same time,

22
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,460
and it's got some example CLI and

23
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,379
PowerShell scripts you can use to call

24
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,110
the templates as well as some .NET and

25
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,719
Ruby SDK information. We can see we have

26
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,100
no inputs, plus we have no outputs. We'll

27
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,350
have some of those when we go through

28
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,730
things later on but that's essentially

29
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,649
the information you get when you are

30
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,940
looking via the portal.

31
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:02,370
If you're using either the

32
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,640
PowerShell AzureRM cmdlets or you're

33
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,450
using the CLI 2.0 az commands you can

34
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,409
get to that same information

35
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,409
programmatically.

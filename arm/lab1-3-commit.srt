1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:04,500
OK, so let's get in the habit of

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,509
actually saving our files and

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,490
in a strcutured way by committing them locally

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:11,400
to the repository and then pushing those

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,540
changes up into GitHub. You can see

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,820
now we've got the change that we've

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,920
saved, into the file over here on the

8
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,810
left hand side.  The source control symbol,

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,400
the Git symbol, is now showing that

10
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,810
there's one file which is changed. We

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,359
click on that and we can see it's listed.

12
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,769
If you hover over that you will be

13
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,990
able to click on the '+' which will

14
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:30,480
then stage that change locally ready to

15
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,009
be committed.  We can add a message in -

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,590
I'm just going to put in the 'Initial

17
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,210
commit' into the box there  - then if you

18
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,969
hit CTRL+ENTER at the same time

19
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,160
then that'll commit the change into your

20
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:43,290
local repository.  At this point in time

21
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,149
it's only local and there's nothing pushed

22
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,469
up into GitHub. You've got a couple of

23
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,170
ways to do this but the easiest way of

24
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,520
doing it is to hover over the sync symbol

25
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,140
here.  For you it should should show

26
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,420
there's nothing to come down and one

27
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,000
change to go up.   And then you can click

28
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,489
on the sync and it will whirl round and

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,559
then commit those changes up into the

30
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,559
GitHub repository under your ID.

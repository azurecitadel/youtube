1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:06,240
Let's add the snippets into

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:09,630
Visual Studio Code. If you open up this

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,900
snippets file -  so this is provided by Sam

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:15,599
Cogan -  and do CTRL-A and CTR-C to

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,940
copy the contents from that file and then go

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,560
to vscode.  You can go through the file menu

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,600
to get to the User Snippet if you want.

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,060
File -> Preferences -> User Snippets.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,330
The quickest way is to use the Settings cog

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,820
and then choose User Snippets from there

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,769
and if you search for json.json in

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,420
the list to open.

13
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,010
This is the default file.

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,020
You can see this one is empty, it's just

15
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,649
got the opening and closing brace, top and

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,180
bottom, and then some comments which are

17
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,820
slightly outside of the JSON standard.

18
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,530
If I hit enter where the cursor is now

19
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,800
I'll take it down within that section

20
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,719
and then we can paste the contents of

21
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,570
the snippets into there. Now I'm just

22
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,610
going to do CTRL+SHIFT+M to show any

23
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,690
errors and there's a pull request 

24
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,070
against these at the moment because

25
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,980
there's a missing comma in the file.

26
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,899
You can see that if I put one here

27
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,760
I'll get rid of that red line against 

28
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,100
dependsOn and then it's syntactically

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,460
good. If you've got Eric Lynd's

30
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,020
JSON tools you can do CTRL+ALT+M

31
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:15,390
against the whole file and that will

32
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,299
just slightly tidy up everything within

33
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,830
it. Save the file (CTRL+S).

34
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,080
As you can see it's got the little round

35
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,189
dot to show it's got unsaved changes. 

36
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,049
Save the file and you can

37
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:28,259
close it down. Right, to test that

38
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:30,780
everything's working type CTRL+N and that will

39
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,400
create a new file.  We'll call it test.json.

40
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,930
I'm just going to put this

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:43,500
straight into my downloads folder and name it

42
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:46,470
test.json and by doing that it will it'll

43
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,759
automatically know it's a JSON file at

44
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,630
the bottom right here, which means it's

45
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,909
going to start picking up on the

46
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,490
snippets.  If I type "arm" at this

47
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,890
point then you should see this list of

48
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,110
snippets come up as soon as you do that.

49
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,090
If I pick the top one which is the

50
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,640
skeleton arm template, hit enter at that

51
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,229
point and then do CTRL+S to save those

52
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,610
changes.  That is our default ARM

53
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:07,610
template and our snippets are working.

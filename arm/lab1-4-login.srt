1
00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:03,689
Before we can create a resource group

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,970
and submit the template into it, we need

3
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:07,259
to log in to Azure.  The good news is once

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,550
you've logged into Azure then you'll be

5
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:13,349
logged in for about a week.  If you do

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,450
CTRL+' or go through

7
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:17,490
View and then Integrated Terminal

8
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,750
then this will pop up. This is the Bash

9
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,820
version, you may want to set up the

10
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,130
PowerShell version. I'm going to type

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,199
in 'az login'.  I've already logged myself out

12
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,269
to go through this process again.  Now

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,609
this should automatically open up a

14
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:31,529
window with the code - it's a bit

15
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,149
slicker than it used to be - and then you go

16
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:36,390
through the credential process, which for

17
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:38,040
me is just clicking on that, and then

18
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,420
it will authenticate you using

19
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,059
multi-factor authentication if need be

20
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,010
and get you logged in.  Now if like me you

21
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:48,539
have multiple subscriptions then you can

22
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,370
do 'az account list'. I'm going to do that in

23
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:53,489
the table format rather than the coloured

24
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,860
JSON (jsonc) you see there. That'll

25
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,050
list out my multiple subscriptions. I'm

26
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:02,300
going to pick this one here, take that

27
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:05,159
code, and then if I do 'az account set

28
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:09,780
--subscription' and then paste in that

29
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:12,600
subscription GUID and that should show

30
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,860
the right one.  You can always show at any

31
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,140
point to which one you're in, your

32
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,970
context, if you do 'ad account show' and

33
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,030
that'll show you which subscription you're

34
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:24,000
in and also whether or not you're a person or if

35
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,170
you're a Managed Service Identity (MSI) or if you

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,689
are logging in using the Service Principal (SP)

37
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,689
but for most of you, you''ll be a user.

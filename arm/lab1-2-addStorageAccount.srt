1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,460
OK, let's add a storage account

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,020
resource into this empty template. 

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,519
Move the cursor down inbetween the

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,110
square brackets which denotes the

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,750
resources array.  (You can obviously have

6
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,219
multiple resources within a template.)

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,529
Hit enter, it will drop down a line and

8
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:21,210
automatically indent neatly for us.

9
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:22,500
If you then type in "arm-stg" then that

10
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,750
will bring up the storage account

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,820
snippet. It automatically highlights

12
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,830
"storageAccount1" which is used both

13
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,359
for the name and for our displayName tag

14
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,510
which is a bit superfluous but we'll keep

15
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:36,300
it in there. I want you to replace this with

16
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,610
something which is unique for you.

17
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,350
I'm going to put in my alias and then

18
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,719
"stgacct" afterwards. This needs to be

19
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,090
globally unique as this forms part of the

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:49,289
FQDN, the fully qualified domain name,

21
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:52,710
which is used to access the various HTTPS

22
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:55,469
endpoints for blob, for file, for table,

23
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,850
for queue, and therefore it needs to be

24
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:58,320
globally unique. So enter in your

25
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,460
storage account name so it's unique.  Maybe add

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,379
a few numbers at the end to make

27
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,769
sure. The naming conventions for that can

28
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:07,560
be between 3 and 24 characters and

29
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:10,939
alphanumeric, all lowercase. Once you're

30
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,939
done, CTRL+S to save.

1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,620
Before we move on with lab 2, just

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,140
want to go through API versions very

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,059
quickly. If I navigate using the

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,559
JSON outline tool down to our resources

5
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,809
and our storage account,

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,750
then what you see at the top of the

7
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:17,430
file is very standard.  We have the 

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,070
type which is our resource

9
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,109
provider / resource type.  We then have

10
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,510
the name for the resource, the API

11
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,340
version, and then the location. 

12
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,369
This could be in any order you want. 

13
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,140
Location is commonly set to the same

14
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:32,340
location as the resource group itself so

15
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,770
again West Europe for the resource group.

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,540


17
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,390
The API version as you can see here is the

18
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,480
15th June 2015 so this is not a

19
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:45,530
particularly new one. As new features get

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,820
added into the various Azure services

21
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:50,399
then if they require additional

22
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,379
properties to go into the ARM JSON

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,120
standard for that resource type then the schema

24
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:56,309
gets updated for that resource.

25
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,620
I'm going to take a copy of the resource type.

26
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:01,430
"Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts"

27
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:06,030
Go to a browser and go to

28
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:08,340
https://aka.ms/armref.

29
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,979
That'll take us through to the ARM

30
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,180
reference area.  It's very structured

31
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,830
in the way it is organized.  You can

32
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,090
navigate through just browsing on the

33
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,250
left hand side into the various

34
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,380
providers and then into the resource

35
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,619
types and sub resources whin those.

36
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:25,200
Or you can append to the URL at

37
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,299
the top here and put in the provider

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,790
type and that'll take you straight

39
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,369
through to the reference page.

40
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:35,189
You get a full resource

41
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:36,750
template description.  

42
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:40,979
It shows you the API version.

43
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,630
This is February 2018 and it has some

44
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:44,130
information for the properties

45
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,939
within it and some of the

46
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,439
sub objects that form the fuller

47
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:51,390
definition so if you want to have a look

48
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,549
at v2 storage accounts or anything to do with

49
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,869
encryption then you'll see the

50
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:56,869
additional detail within there.
